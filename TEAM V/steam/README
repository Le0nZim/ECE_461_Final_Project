SUMMARY & USAGE LICENSE
=============================================

This dataset is provided by Keagle through the link: https://www.kaggle.com/tamber/steam-video-games/data.

* Context
Steam is the world's most popular PC Gaming hub, with over 6,000 games and a community of millions of gamers. With a massive collection that includes everything from AAA blockbusters to small indie titles, great discovery tools are a highly valuable asset for Steam. How can we make them better?

* Content
This dataset is a list of user behaviors, with columns: user-id, game-title, behavior-name, value. The behaviors included are 'purchase' and 'play'. The value indicates the degree to which the behavior was performed - in the case of 'purchase' the value is always 1, and in the case of 'play' the value represents the number of hours the user has played the game.

* Acknowledgements
This dataset is generated entirely from public Steam data, so we want to thank Steam for building such an awesome platform and community!

the information of purchase and play hours.
