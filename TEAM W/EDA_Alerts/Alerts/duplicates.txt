Duplicates as Separate Events: If each row represents an individual listening event (e.g., each play of a song by a customer at different times), then what appears as "duplicates" might actually be separate events. In such cases, even if the customer, song, and play count are the same, each row could represent a distinct instance of listening, and thus, keeping duplicates would be meaningful.
